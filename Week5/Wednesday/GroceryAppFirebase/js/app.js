// Create a grocery list app which allows you to add different categories. Here are list of requested features. 
// * User should be able to add the grocery category (Walmart, HEB, Fiesta, Sams Club etc)  (name and address)
// * User should be able to view all grocery categories 
// * User should be able to delete grocery categories
// * Items must be stored in Firebase database 
// * The website should be mobile responsive 

// HARD MODE:
// * Add user registration and authentication 
// * Allow user to add items to the grocery categories
// * Allow the user to login and then store the categories for that user. This means each category in Firebase will be associated with a particular user. 

let groceryCatRef = database.ref('categories')





// groceryCatRef.on('value', snap => console.log(snap.val()))
