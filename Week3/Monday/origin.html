                    <p>To be honest, I'm not an expert on snacks or snack history. When I started this website, I figured a quick Google search would provide me with all the information I would need. After all, it's the age of information. There should be plenty of information on a product created a company as large as Nabisco right? Right?</p>
                    <p>Wrong. There was surprisngly little information to be found regarding Nutter Butter wafers. To be fair, I didn't look very hard. But I still expected more. I ran into dead ends. Instead of answers, I just found more questsions. My google search returned results like the following:</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="largeimagecontainer">
                <img src="images/google1.png"/>
            </div>
            <div class="largeimagecontainer">
                <img src="images/google2.png"/>
            </div>
            <div class="contentcontainer">
                <div>
                    <p>"Does anyone remember the Nutter Butter wafers they used to sell?" "Where are these sold?" These were, sadly, some of the most promising search results that turned up. The most helpful result was probably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3ANutter_Butter">Nutter Butter Wiki</a>, which really wasn't very helpful at all.</p>
