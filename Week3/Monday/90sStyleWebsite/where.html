                    <p>Ever since I moved from Hawaii to the mainland, I've noticed I can't find Nutter Butter wafers anywhere. Oh, sure, Nutter Butter cookies are everywhere...but where are the wafers??</p>
                    <p>Surprisingly, as I tried to discover the origin of Nutter Butter wafers, I came across an interesting reference in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3ANutter_Butter">wiki</a>. The wiki points to another link stating: "http://genkitummy.blogspot.com/2008/05/nutter-butter-creme-patties.html is a good reference overall, but it's a blog entry". So, I followed the link and what did I find? Another post from a person from Hawaii wondering where in the world to get Nutter Butter wafers on the mainland!!!</p>
                    <p>At this point I'm thinking, "ok, it's pretty obvious these things are regional". I take a look at the Nabisco website to confirm my suspicions. Luckily, they have a product locator, so I just type in my zip code and pull the trigger.</p>

                    <p>Um, Nabisco claims they sell this product at pretty much every grocery store near me. I will have to verify this claim by going into the stores in person, but I'm confident this locator is wrong. For now, assume there is a grand conspiracy surrounding Nutter Butter wafers.</p>
